A self-hosted personal api that will help me manage my life. 

Future plans are to integrate with tasker, qpython, jira, toggl,
 slack, and a bazillion other things. 
 
todo: 

* endpoint to get information about commute time CHECK

* webpage that asks for login if the user isn't on my home wifi
  * if the user is on home wifi, show them menu stuff instead (read only), with option to log in as me
  * otherwise, allow no navigation from landing page

* web frontend for everything
